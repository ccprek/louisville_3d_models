====================

Louisville, KY USA Downtown building STL and Sketch-Up files

This is a collection of STL models of Louisville, KY buildings suitable for 3D printing. Original units as meters are scaled to millimeters in the STL and thus rendered to 1/1000th scale.

Originally, these files were used in a LVL1 Hackerspace 3D printing exhibition for Vision Louisville at IdeaFestival 2012. They are shared here as public domain works under a Creative Commons 1.0 Universal License.
